# no-image-ubuntu
This project will be an open-source project.
The goal is to create an OS where all the use of images is restricted.

## OS Choice
This OS will be at first a clone of the UBUNTU DESKTOP OS.
why ubuntu? 
First, because it is open source and the source code is available. not like Windows and Mac.
Secondly, because it is, I think, the most used distribution.

## Pathway
This will be achieved by :\
1- removing all media codecs from the CORE OS\
2- remove media support from browsers\
3- block anyway to install or download media codecs

## Who needs this?
well, on the internet, images are one of the most misused tools.
Many self and parental control these days are expensive and does not get you to the point where you are safe on the internet.
this should be done from the bottom-up procedure.
